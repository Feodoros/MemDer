## Creating history

It all began on VK hackathon. We were given a case where we should have done an app with entertaining content.
After a long time thinking and discussing we came up with an idea: "Why don't we make something new in domain of humor and dating?".
Sounds weird. But we believed in this and started to develop the idea. So we made what we made! 
Firstly we called it "Laugh and Love", but nobody liked the name. In the mean time we gave name "MemDer" to the folder with project.
So, as it usually happens, everybody enjoyed it: laconically and telling.
This is how appeared a reason to work many days at our project.
So MemDer was born!
